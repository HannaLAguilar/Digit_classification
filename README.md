# Digit Classification

The classification project using CNN consists of three phases:

* Processing the data, including data augmentation
* Defining the CNN architecture
* Train and test the model

The CNN architecture was a simple one, combing a Convolutional, Pooling and Fully-Connected layers. 
After 20 epochs, which during at 1min 30s, the final valid accuracy was 98%. Testing the
model, every class reached more than 98%, except the number 8m which readched 93%
 (eight, you are difficult!).

Also, there is a [notebook](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Digit_classification/blob/main/Digit_classification.ipynb) for better visualization ;).
